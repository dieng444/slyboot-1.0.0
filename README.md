# slyboot-1.0.0

Slyboot is a mini php framework that I developed,
it allows developers to create strong and secure 
web applications. The framework includes a route 
component allowing developers to specify themselves route names (path).

The framework also includes a form handler, 
allowing developers to create and validate robust and secure forms.
